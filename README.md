# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## Course Project
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Instructions
Download the run_analysis.R script and run it in RStudio.
The script will download the raw data in your working directory and will process the data as described above.
Eventually the file TidyData.txt with the described information above will be created in your working directory.
